      <h3>Single mothers</h3>
      <p>It's hard to say and admit it, but the truth is tat single mothers will always blame theim former partners.</p>
      <p>It gets much more irritated when these women woud start facing a starving daily life and fail to support their children finacially, not because they don't love them, but because it's hard to have grown people depend on you when you're a single parent and not having an highly paying job.</p>

 <h3>Single fathers</h3>        
      <p class="w3-small">In most cases single fathers fail to be loved by their children. They treated as the betrayers and cheaters by their former partners.  </br>
