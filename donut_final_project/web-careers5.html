				<h2>Design vs Development</h2>

		<p>Depending on the size of the organization, job descriptions for web-based careers may include experts in graphic design, content creation, programming, and usability testing. In smaller organizations, the web designer and the web developer may be the only employees working on web projects. Most web designers are more marketable if they have at least some knowledge of web coding. Most web developers are more marketable if they have some knowledge of the importance of design and how the site looks. Students interested in a web career should accumulate skills in both areas whenever possible.</p>

	<h2>Web Developers</h2>

Most developers build a foundation in programming abilities to enable them to learn to program in any language.  Programming languages and web development tools often mentioned in job listings include: Perl, C,  Ajax, Python, Ruby and scripting.  Knowing how to build a database and use it on the web is also an asset to a developer's resume.</p>
