		"features": "To match its high-end internal specs, the viewing experience of the Predator 8 is promisingly spectacular. The 1,920x1,200-pixel resolution FHD screen features an impressively wide range of colors, and it claims to support 100 per cent of the NTSC color gamut -- a great feat for any screen, let alone a tablet. To enhance games, the Predator TacSense feature provides tactile feedback on the screen when gaming, supplying an extra oomph during game play. You'll find a speaker on each corner of Predator 8. This quad-speaker set-up is meant to make gaming (or video, we assume) more immersive, with virtual surround sound. Acer's Predator MediaMaster is a unique app that helps you take full advantage of the powerful speakers. Depending on whether you're watching a movie, playing a game, or lurking on Facebook, the app has different pre-settings that optimize the screen and sound performance."
